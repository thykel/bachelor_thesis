###MODELLING NEW NETWORK ARCHITECTURES IN OMNET++


This thesis describes principles and state of implementation of selected new network architectures. It also documents implementation of the Relaying and Multiplexing Task module of one of the presented architectures, Recursive InterNetwork Architecture (RINA), for the OMNeT++ simulation framework. The main goal of this thesis is to extend functionality of an existing simulation library to provide a full-fledged means for modelling RINA networks.
